# Fire & Flames

<h2>Description:</h2>
Fire & Flames is a VR training application for firefighters on a PC where people can practice basic fundamentals of their job. The goal was to create safe environment where anyone can make a mistake and learn how to avoid them in the future. Application was available on Valve Index and Oculus Quest via Oculus Link and experience was enhanced by VR treadmill. Simulation is multiplayer game where 2 firefighters cooperate on different scenarios while 3rd user called Spectator (examiner/trainer) is watching how they are doing. The biggest challenge of the application was creating fire system which was supported by 3rd party asset for liquids and making it all work via networking. Simulator is already used as a tool for firefigher trainings in few facilities in Poland and there are plans for going into global market.
